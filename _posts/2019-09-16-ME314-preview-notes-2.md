The second section will talk about the practice problems for Chapter 1(Statics) of the textbook "Introduction to Classical Mechanics"(David Morin).

> It's 2019 and I am still working on statics ...

The third problem "Motionless chain" required us to exploit the idea of derivative to statics problems. While the method for this problem is relatively simple, this idea of derivative can be extremely important for problems later.

For the forth problem "Keeping the book up", one thing worth mentioning is that the friction force here would always be upward. I don't really understand why and just take it as conclusion for now.

The fifth problem "Objects between circles" is not hard itself, but the calculation might be a little bit tedious.

The sixth problem "Hanging rope" started to talk about tension, which I think is a relatively hard topic in this chapter, but this problem is simple.

The seventh problem "Rope on a plane" is interesting, the solution talked about all the cases with related results.

The eighth problem "Supporting a disk" can be considered as the extention of the "Rope wrapped around a pole" example. If you are famaliar with the example, this should not be a problem. I have two questions about the solution provided:
1. Why "massless" can lead to constant tension?
2. Why the normal force can be written as $Nd\theta$? The book just took this directly without any deviation.

Even though the nineth problem "Hanging chain" is marked as a four-star problem, I think it's not that scary. If you are familiar with the idea of "derivative", then it's not hard to obtain a basically correct routine, but some math tricks may be required to solve the final results.
