Here are the information I collected about professors' research at Neuroscience and Robotics Labratory(NxR Lab) at Northwestern. It might help new incoming graduate students to have a basic first impression about what they are doing. The information here do not include those you can easily find through the Internet (for example, their websites or first page search results after entering the name in Google or Youtube).

> However, the best way is always to talk and ask directly to the professor and their PhD students.

## General

* Mccormick School of Engineering Research News published at Dec 2015 named "[Engineering Touch](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2015/12/engineering-touch.html)", many professors at NxR Lab attended the video.

## Robotic Manipulation (Prof. Kevin Lynch)

* Prof. Lynch's speech at Robotics@MIT Seminar 2018: [**Motion Planning and Control for Robot and Human Manipulation**](https://replay.csail.mit.edu/recordings/1083).

* Prof. Lynch's PhD Advisor, Prof. Mason at CMU published a review paper about robot manipulation on *Annual Reviews* at 2018: [**Toward Robotic Manipulation**](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-control-060117-104848).

* Another review paper about robot manipulation published on *Science* at 2019 that I found very helpful: [**Trends and challenges in robot manipulation**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6446/eaat8414).

* Website for Prof. Lynch's book [**Modern Robotics**](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics), which is a comprehensive introduction textbook for mathematical fundamentals for robotics. This book also has a related Coursera course, you can find the information at the website, too.

## Surface Haptics (Prof. Edward Colgate and Prof. Michael Peshkin)

* Their speech at Microsoft Research at 2011: [**Surface Haptics: Virtual Touch on Physical Surfaces**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOYspQKBxMU).

* Prof. Colgate has a series of blogs about haptics technology on *Medium*, you can find them [**here**](https://medium.com/@colgate_31072).

* A review paper about haptics technology published on *Annual Reviews* at 2018: [**Haptics: The Present and Future of Artificial Touch Sensation**](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-control-060117-105043).

## Rehabilitation Robotics (Prof. Brenna Argall)

* Prof. Argall published a review paper about rehabilitation robotics on *Annual Reviews* at 2018 (what a journal ...): [**Autonomy in Rehabilitation Robotics: An Intersection**](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-control-061417-041727?af=R).
